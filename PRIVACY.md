## User Data
We do not collect any data from our users. All quizzes are saved locally on your device, and we do not access or store:
 - Images
 - URLs
 - Notes you add to your quizzes
                                
Additionally, we do not collect any analytics. Please continue reading to understand the terms and conditions that Google's Gemini impose on your data.
                                
## Third-Party Services
We integrate with Google's Gemini to provide multi-modal models for quiz generation. When you use these services, we provide them with the following user information:
- Images
- URLs
- Text-based notes (anything you input to make a quiz)
                                
This information is necessary for the models to generate quizzes. However, please be aware that:
- If you are using the free API key from Google, they may train models on your prompts and you may be susceptible to rate limits.
                                
Please review the terms of service and privacy policies for this third-party service:
