## Description
Recap is your *free* amigo who will help quiz you on the __SPECIFIC concepts__ you are learning about. Most online resources don't cover exactly what you learn at school. How do you know if you have fully understood a concept or not? You for sure don't want to "wait and find out ðŸ˜£".

## Installation
To get started with Recap, follow these steps:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TopGApps/Recap

# Navigate to the project directory
cd recap

# Open the project in Xcode
open Recap.xcodeproj
```

## Usage
To use Recap, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Select your target device or simulator.
3. Click the "Run" button or press `Cmd + R` to build and run the app.

## Features
- Personalized quizzes based on your specific learning materials.
- Supports input from images, URLs, and plaintext.
- Industry-first level of personalization using Gemini 1.5 Pro.
- `Explain` button to help you understand the concepts better.

## How It Works
As mentioned previously, we prompt Gemini with your input, and it returns a JSON with the quiz info, which we parse and put in a JSON. We then parse the JSON, rendering the quiz UI.

## Why Us?

- **Impact**: We are the first quizzing iOS app to use Gemini's large context window to deliver accurate quizzes. Our solution is designed to be easy and enjoyable for everyone, including people with disabilities. SwiftUI provides robust accessibility features out-of-the-box, such as VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and support for various input methods. By choosing SwiftUI, we ensure that our app is accessible to a wider audience, including those with visual, auditory, and motor impairments. Additionally, we have localized the app to Spanish, making it accessible to a broader user base. Our app has the potential to contribute meaningfully to improving people's lives by providing personalized learning experiences.

- **Remarkability**: Our approach is surprising both to those well-versed and not well-versed in Large Language Models (LLM). The use of Gemini 1.5 Pro for personalized quizzing is unprecedented. This innovative use of LLM technology sets our app apart from existing solutions and showcases the potential of advanced AI in educational tools.

- **Creativity**: Recap differs from existing applications in both functionality and user experience. We use creative problem-solving approaches to offer a unique and personalized quizzing experience. Our app supports input from various resources like images, URLs, and plaintext, which is not commonly found in other quizzing apps. This flexibility allows users to create quizzes tailored to their specific learning materials.

- **Usefulness**: We have a well-defined target user personaâ€”students who need personalized quizzes to reinforce their learning. Our solution addresses specific user needs by allowing input from various resources like images, URLs, and plaintext. The app's design ensures that it meets these needs effectively, helping users to better understand and retain the concepts they are studying.

- **Execution**: The solution is well-designed and adheres to software engineering practices. The LLM component is also well-designed and follows Machine Learning (ML)/LLM best practices. By leveraging SwiftUI, we ensure that our app is not only visually appealing but also highly accessible and inclusive. The app's architecture and code quality are robust, modular, and maintainable, ensuring that it can be easily extended and updated in the future. We follow best practices such as code reviews and continuous integration to maintain high standards of code quality and reliability.

## Disclaimers
- When inputting your personal API key, be aware of the fact that on a free account, your prompts are linked to your identity and are used to train their models.
- While we, Recap, do not collect any data from our users, there's nothing stopping Google from collecting YOUR data, so be sure to read *their* privacy policies to be aware of what's going on.
