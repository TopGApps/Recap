## Inspiration

As professional high schoolers, we understand the pain and frustation that students feel when studying. Teachers often don't provide study notes, with most online help pages are paywalled, and students are often left purely reading the textbook over and over again.

Introducing... ElonMigo - a game-changing learning experience that turns studying into an engaging, personalized journey! Our app empowers students with one-on-one tutoring tailored to their needs, ensuring they no longer face the frustration of traditional study methods.

## What it does

ElonMigo's AI can use your own custom input prompt, "look" at images, and visit websites to quiz you on the content! You can answer multiple-choice questions and free-response questions and get personalized feedback to see where you went wrong. There's also motivational messages to ensure you get that dopamine boost. ðŸ˜€

## How we built it

We use state-of-the-art technology from Apple's vast variety of frameworks and libraries to ensure the smoothest user experience. We used Swift, to ensure type-safety and memory-safety. Additonally, we used Google's GoogleGenerativeAI to access the powerful Gemini API, with a token limit of up to 128,000 tokens!, with additional custom-built components tailored specifically for maximum study productivity!

## Challenges we ran into

Although our coding journey was largely successful, there were a few bumps along the way. For instance, we faced some difficulties while working with the visionOS simulator, which unfortunately crashed frequently, even on powerful systems with 128GB of unified memory. This issue presented us with a significant challenge that required extensive troubleshooting and creative problem-solving.

Another obstacle we overcame was managing several git merge conflicts during the development process. These conflicts arose when we made changes to the same codebase simultaneously, requiring us to carefully examine each conflict and make informed decisions about how to integrate the changes seamlessly. Despite these hurdles, we remained persistent in finding solutions and delivering a high-quality, polished app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're thrilled that we can now offer every student their own personal 1-on-1 tutor, democratizing access to high-quality education! With just one click of a button, anyone can study precisely what's on their test and receive a customized, 1-on-1 tutoring experience right in their pocket. We believe that education should be accessible to all, regardless of economic background, and we're proud to contribute to this mission by providing an affordable and convenient solution for students everywhere.

## What we learned

During the development process, we learned the art of parsing large JSON files efficiently in Swift. By using specialized libraries and frameworks, we were able to extract relevant data quickly, ensuring a smooth user experience. Additionally, we gained extensive expertise in developing for new platforms like visionOS, enabling us to create innovative solutions tailored to cutting-edge technologies.

Along the way, we also honed our skills in resolving git merge conflicts, which allowed us to effectively manage and integrate changes made by multiple team members simultaneously. By carefully analyzing each conflict and collaborating closely, we were able to ensure that all updates were seamlessly integrated into the codebase, minimizing potential disruptions and delivering a high-quality final product.

## What's next for ElonMigo

We are thrilled to announce that this journey isn't over! We will be extending our app with a massive UI redesign, taking user experience to new heights! We've carefully planned and designed an intuitive and visually stunning interface that is sure to delight users.

We'll be incorporating cutting-edge design elements and utilizing the latest UI frameworks available on Apple platforms to deliver a seamless and enjoyable experience for all our users. The redesign will include improvements to the app's navigation, layout, typography, color scheme, and overall aesthetics. Additionally, we'll ensure that the new design is optimized for accessibility, making it easy for everyone to use.

Once the UI redesign is complete, we will submit our app to the App Store, where it will be available for download by users around the world. We are confident that this upgrade will further solidify our app's position as a top choice for learners seeking personalized and engaging educational experiences. Stay tuned for the release of our newly redesigned app!
